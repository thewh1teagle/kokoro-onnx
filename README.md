<summary>Instructions</summary>

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) for isolated Python (Recommend).

Basically open the terminal (PowerShell / Bash) and run the command listed in their website.

_Note: you don't have to use `uv`. but it just make things much simpler. You can use regular Python as well._

2. Create new project folder (you name it)
3. Run in the project folder

```console
uv init -p 3.12
uv add kokoro-onnx soundfile
```

4. Paste the contents of [`examples/save.py`](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/blob/main/examples/save.py) in `hello.py`
5. Download the files [`kokoro-v1.0.onnx`](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/kokoro-v1.0.onnx), and [`voices-v1.0.bin`](https://github.com/thewh1teagle/kokoro-onnx/releases/download/model-files-v1.0/voices-v1.0.bin) and place them in the same directory.
6. Run

```console
uv run hello.py
```

You can edit the text in `hello.py`

That's it! `audio.wav` should be created.
